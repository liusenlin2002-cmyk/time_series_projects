Data Challenge

## 1. Problem Definition
We aim to predict next-period returns using historical information only.
All evaluation is conducted under a strict time-series framework to avoid look-ahead bias.

---

## 2. Data Description
- Asset universe:
- Frequency:
- Sample period:

Potential data leakage risks are explicitly considered and mitigated.

---

## 3. Feature Engineering
- Price-based features
- Rolling statistics (backward-looking only)
- Cross-sectional normalization by date
- Winsorization to reduce outlier impact

---

## 4. Experimental Setup
- Walk-forward / rolling window evaluation
- No shuffling
- Test data never used in training or tuning

---

## 5. Baseline Models
- Linear regression / Ridge
- XGBoost (default parameters)

These serve as performance benchmarks.

---

## 6. Advanced Models
- XGBoost with extended features
- (Optional) Temporal feature extraction via LSTM

Complexity is introduced only when justified by OOS improvement.

---

## 7. Evaluation Metrics
- Information Coefficient (IC)
- Rank IC
- Portfolio-level long-short returns

---

## 8. Results
- OOS IC summary
- Rolling performance plots
- Feature importance stability

---

## 9. Robustness Checks
- Subperiod analysis
- Turnover inspection
- Sensitivity to hyperparameters

---

## 10. Limitations & Future Work
- Limited sample size
- Transaction costs not fully modeled
- Regime dependence

Results should be interpreted with these constraints in mind.
